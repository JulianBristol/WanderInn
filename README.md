 An Airbnb clone that uses TypeScript, Next.js 14, MongoDB, and TailwindCSS to display several homes and locations for rent. This project uses responsive design, so that it useable on mobile, tablet, and desktop, Credential authentication using traditional email and password as well as Github and Google authentication, Cloudinary CDN for image uploads, React Hook Form for simple form processing, React Toast for notifications, and more.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
